Termite Control
What are Termites?
Termites are relatively small insects with wings. They are commonly found in warmer climates and thrive in colonies. As such, they can easily infect your house. They receive their nutrition from decaying matter, such as wood and dead plants. So, if an infestation is present, you are likely to see it in your walls. The worst part about termites is that they are always hungry and always chewing away at their food. As a result, the damage spreads very quickly. It is very hard to find and treat termites before you see the damage. 
Signs of Infestation
The most common types of termites are dry wood, damp wood, and subterranean termites. As the names suggest, they can be found in any of those environments. However, there are some helpful tips that you can use to locate termites. Here are some signs that will help you determine if you have a termite infestation:
1.	Sounds: The sounds that termites make can sometimes be hard to discern. However, it’s an important factor for a lookout. Termites make a very distinct clicking sound. They even bang their heads against wood if they sense danger. If you put your ear to a wall, you can easily hear them eating at the wood. 
2.	Flying Termites: Termites who have not mated yet have wings. So, if you see something funky flying around, give it a closer look! Another way to detect this is by looking for shed wings. 
3.	White Ants: Termites are often confused with white ants. But the first thing to note is that white ants do not even exist. If you see an ant-like insect that is translucent/white, it may simply be a termite. Termites also have straight antennae and a thick body. Some termites may also have wings.  
4.	Problems in the Wood: Termites like to chew at the wood. Hollow, chewed up, cracked, and tunneled walls are all signs of a termite infestation. 
Problems Caused by Infestation
Wood is not the only thing that will get attacked in your house by a termite. Termites create nests in ducts and ventilation systems. It can increase dust particles and other issues in your heating system. Increased dust causes even more problems. People with asthma problems can struggle in this environment. You can have several health issues on your hands. 
Termites can also get into your beds—as if you didn’t have reason enough to sleep in an infested home already. And lastly, termites ruin the infrastructure of the home. The price to treat termites is hefty, but you’ll have to pay even more for the repairs. 
Why Call a Professional?
Calling professionals is the best idea because they have the tools and knowledge to treat termites. Termites are stubborn, sneaky creatures. They tend to hide in crevices and little compartments. These places can be especially hard to reach if you are doing it DIY style. A professional can access—as well as determine—the hiding places of termites.
Another reason to call a professional is that home remedy methods are often ineffective. Let’s say you have a small structure infested with termites. You may be able to solve the problem on your own. But if the infestation is growing or already severe, don’t try to treat it yourself. Termites often access homes from the underground. A professional may have to dig up foundations or apply termiticide inside these systems. They may also have to inject it inside walls or behind crevices. 
Termite Treatments and Pest Control Methods
Termite control generally has two forms: liquid and bait. 
Liquid treatments for termites are known as termiticides. These chemicals include special ingredients that help get rid of termites. Some common ingredients found in termiticides are cyfluthrin, bifenthrin, and fipronil. You must not conduct these termite treatments yourself. Misuse may result in even more problems. For example, you may cause contamination in the water system. It will not kill termites but will damage the health of individuals as well as the environment.
The second of the two termite pest control methods are bait. It is what it sounds. A bait can look like a structure that termites would normally feed. However, it acts as a slow-acting insecticide. When the termites start feeding on it, they will eventually die. You can also choose to add baits when there is not an infestation. It can be a tool that will help you look out for future termites. Besides, bait is your best option if all other termite pest control methods have failed. It is also a great option for places that do not allow the injection of pesticides. 
There are also other methods of pest control. These are not common but can still be used to control termites. 
1.	Wood Treatments: If you are building a home and would like it to be free of termites, you can choose to treat your wood. It is normally a spray to put on wood during the construction of a structure. 
2.	Non-Chemical Treatments: Non-chemical treatments can include concrete walls or barriers put into place—also during construction. Some examples of this are steel mesh and plastic barriers. Non-chemical treatments also include natural alternatives, such as fungi. These agents are just as effective as any other pest control methods. However, they may be difficult to control outside of a laboratory environment. 
Summing Up
Termites are nasty creatures that can infest your home and create a lot of problems. Once they enter the structure, they can ruin it from both the inside and the outside. That is why it is important to be aware of the signs of a termite infestation. These can range anywhere from unusual sounds to shed wings found in your home. It is also important to treat termites with the help of a professional. If it is done by yourself, the situation can become worse. While treating termites, you may choose to use chemicals or baits. Chemicals can easily be inserted into structures and other installed systems. Baits are suitable for places that don’t allow these methods.
