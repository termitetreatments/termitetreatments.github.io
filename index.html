Termites?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Termites are relatively small insects with wings. They
are commonly found in warmer climates and thrive in colonies. As such, they can
easily infect your house. They receive their nutrition from decaying matter,
such as wood and dead plants. So, if an infestation is present, you are likely
to see it in your walls. The worst part about termites is that they are always
hungry and always chewing away at their food. As a result, the damage spreads
very quickly. It is very hard to find and treat termites before you see the
damage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:

and subterranean termites. As the names suggest, they can be found in any of
those environments. However, there are some helpful tips that you can use to
locate termites. Here are some signs that will help you determine if you have a
termite infestation:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

     lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The sounds that termites
     make can sometimes be hard to discern. However, it‚Äôs an important factor
     for a lookout. Termites make a very distinct clicking sound. They even
     bang their heads against wood if they sense danger. If you put your ear to
     a wall, you can easily hear them eating at the wood. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

     are often confused with white ants. But the first thing to note is that
     white ants do not even exist. If you see an ant-like insect that is
     translucent/white, it may simply be a termite. Termites also have straight
     antennae and a thick body. Some termites may also have wings.<span

your house by a termite. Termites create nests in ducts and ventilation
systems. It can increase dust particles and other issues in your heating
system. Increased dust causes even more problems. People with asthma problems
can struggle in this environment. You can have several health issues on your
hands. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Termites can also get into your beds‚Äîas if you didn‚Äôt
have reason enough to sleep in an infested home already. And lastly, termites
ruin the infrastructure of the home. The price to treat termites is hefty, but
you‚Äôll have to pay even more for the repairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Calling professionals is the best idea because they
have the tools and knowledge to treat termites. Termites are stubborn, sneaky
creatures. They tend to hide in crevices and little compartments. These places
can be especially hard to reach if you are doing it DIY style. A professional
can access‚Äîas well as determine‚Äîthe hiding places of termites.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Another reason to call a professional is that home
remedy methods are often ineffective. Let‚Äôs say you have a small structure
infested with termites. You may be able to solve the problem on your own. But
if the infestation is growing or already severe, don‚Äôt try to treat it
yourself. Termites often access homes from the underground. A professional may
have to dig up foundations or apply termiticide inside these systems. They may
also have to inject it inside walls or behind crevices. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:

bait. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Liquid treatments for termites are known as
termiticides. These chemicals include special ingredients that help get rid of
termites. Some common ingredients found in termiticides are cyfluthrin,
bifenthrin, and fipronil. You must not conduct these termite treatments
yourself. Misuse may result in even more problems. For example, you may cause
contamination in the water system. It will not kill termites but will damage
the health of individuals as well as the environment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The second of the two termite pest control methods are
bait. It is what it sounds. A bait can look like a structure that termites
would normally feed. However, it acts as a slow-acting insecticide. When the
termites start feeding on it, they will eventually die. You can also choose to
add baits when there is not an infestation. It can be a tool that will help you
look out for future termites. Besides, bait is your best option if all other
termite pest control methods have failed. It is also a great option for places
that do not allow the injection of pesticides. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:10.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>There are also other methods of pest control. These
are not common but can still be used to control termites. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

     include concrete walls or barriers put into place‚Äîalso during
     construction. Some examples of this are steel mesh and plastic barriers.
     Non-chemical treatments also include natural alternatives, such as fungi.
     These agents are just as effective as any other pest control methods.
     However, they may be difficult to control outside of a laboratory
     environment. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></b></span></li>

and create a lot of problems. Once they enter the structure, they can ruin it
from both the inside and the outside. That is why it is important to be aware
of the signs of a termite infestation. These can range anywhere from unusual
sounds to shed wings found in your home. It is also important to treat termites
with the help of a professional. If it is done by yourself, the situation can
become worse. While treating termites, you may choose to use chemicals or
baits. Chemicals can easily be inserted into structures and other installed
systems. Baits are suitable for places that don‚Äôt allow these methods. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
